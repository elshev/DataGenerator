# DataGenerator

SPA site that allows users to generate INSERT INTO sql script from CREATE TABLE sql script. 
You just paste your CREATE TABLE sql script, tune columns(if needed) and get an INSERT INTO sql script.

P.S. Projects was started as a sandbox where I can learn new frameworks and libraries like Angular, Jasmine, ASP.NET Core, etc.
